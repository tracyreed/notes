notes
=====

Over the years I have collected a lot of notes, commands, documentations, etc.
I refer to these things often in doing my job.

Memorization of infrequently used commands is just pointless. 

It isn't what you can remember what matters: It is knowing where to find it.

I am making these available here for others who may find them useful.

Some of these are quite rough and possibly even nonsensical. I generally don't
spend a lot of time making these presentable and professional looking.

Take them for whatever they're worth.
